# Orbiter

A lightweight X11 application launcher with search, system icons, and
Bedrock Linux cross-stratum support. Built with C++17, XCB, Cairo, and Pango.

---

## Features

- **Fast search** — real-time filtering across desktop entry names, exec fields,
  and generic names as you type
- **System icons** — full XDG Icon Theme Spec resolution (SVG via librsvg, PNG)
- **Cross-distro launching** — searches Bedrock strata for apps; displays
  `[stratum]` tags and runs commands in the correct environment
- **Scrollable results** — keyboard navigation with arrows, page up/down,
  home/end; scroll arrows indicate off-screen entries
- **Dark theme** — TOML-configurable colors with DE-aware auto-detection
- **Network & battery metrics** — optional real-time speedometer and power
  status in the corner
- **Background detachment** — launched processes are fully detached

## Bedrock Linux

orbiter automatically detects Bedrock Linux strata and tags each app with its
stratum name: `Firefox [fedora]`, `Alacritty [arch]`.

---

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/Orbiter/config.toml`:

```toml
terminal = "foot"
max_results = 20
show_metrics = true
```

Theme colors can be customized in `~/.config/Orbiter/config.toml`:

```toml
bg_color = "#0b081a"
text_color = "#ffffff"
accent_color = "#00e5ff"
```

DE-specific files (`hyprland.conf`, `sway.conf`, etc.) override the base config
when the matching desktop environment is detected.
